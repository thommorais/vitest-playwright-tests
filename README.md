Set up a new React application.
Fetch a list of users using one of the following methods:
Preferred: Use GraphQL from GraphQLZero with the Apollo Client library (https://graphqlzero.almansi.me/api).
Alternative: If unfamiliar with GraphQL, use a REST API to retrieve posts from JSONPlaceholder (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts).


Display the retrieved data in a table, ideally using the Material-UI library.

Implement pagination for the table, allowing users to adjust the number of rows displayed per page.
Add a search bar above the table that enables filtering based on the user's name (resp. post title).

Ensure the code is optimised and production ready.

7.	Ensure this file is thoroughly tested by writing multiple test cases.
